The group, which was created in 2013, has described itself as a “National Socialist” organization and has made a particular effort to attract young people.In banning the group, the government made membership a criminal offense punishable by up to 10 years in jail. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said at the time that the group “stirs up hatred, glorifies violence and promotes a vile ideologue.” She added: “I will not stand for it. It has absolutely no place in a Britain that works for everyone.”Far-right groups have come under closer scrutiny in recent months amid growing fears that their views are attracting a wider audience, spurred by anti-immigrant sentiment and xenophobia that some analysts say has been driven by Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.Members of National Action have previously praised Thomas Mair, an unemployed gardener obsessed with Nazi propaganda and white supremacist ideology, who in June 2016 was convicted of killing Jo Cox, a Labour member of Parliament. Ms. Cox had supported immigrant causes and Britain remaining in the European Union.When he appeared in court and was asked his name, Mr. Mair replied, “My name is death to traitors, freedom for Britain.” The group co-opted the phrase as a slogan on its former website.Advertisement
